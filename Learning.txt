SwaggerHub is a free and cloud-based API development platform that is used to build, document, manage, and deploy APIs.

SwaggerHub provides a complete solution for designing, managing, and publishing documentation for your 
API in ways that will simplify your life as an API technical writer.

SwaggerHub is used by more than 15,000 software teams across the globe.


*******************

Swagger Editor – a browser-based editor where you can write OpenAPI definitions.

Swagger UI – renders OpenAPI definitions as interactive API documentation, like the one at http://petstore.swagger.io.

Swagger Codegen – generates server code and client libraries based on an OpenAPI definition.

What is Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

Git is the version control software.
GitHub is a hosting solution for your commited changes.
****************


What is GitHub
GitHub is the repository where all files stored

It is a code hosting platfporm for collaboration and version control. It helps you to work with others.
Githubs essentials are repositories, branches, commits, pull requests, git

GitHub pages is a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organizational, or project pages directly from GitHub reository.


What is GitHub?

GitHub is web-based hosting service for Version Control using Git. It offers all functionalities of git as well adding many of its own. You get a much clean web
UI providing great visuals and don’t need to master any CLI. You can comment on changes/revisions made by others, contribute to open source projects, 
fork projects, download projects, upload your projects, make gists, and much much more. You even get a free domain as http://<your_user_name>.github.io/, 
check me out at Madhusudan Rathore,but i haven’t updated it. This is really great as CSE/IT students are expected to have their own portfolio websites. You can 
upload your projects that can be used by others. People can give suggestions, company hiring gets you an advantage as it’s a proof that you have actually 
done work unlike people who say they did projects but are unable to prove it.

What is BitBucket
Bitbucket is a web-based version control repository hosting service owned by Atlassian, for source code and development projects that use 
either Mercurial (since launch) or Git (since October 2011[2]) revision control systems.

What is API Documantation

What is ReDoc
Redoc is an authoring tool
ReDoc provides a simple, clean, and attractive altenatives to documantation.
ReDoc is the responsive, three panel, openAPI driven documentation for your API.
ReDoc leverages a custom HTML tag, and provides you with a handful of attributes for defining, and customizing their documentation, 
including specurl, scroll-y-offset, suppress-warnings, lazy-rendering, hid-hostname, and expand-responses--providing some quick ways 
to get exactly what you need, on any web page.

Usage of commands and HTML code
ReDoc is an alternative to SwaggerHub

Version control system
Suppose you’re working your new project with 3 of your colleagues. The planning, timeline, etc for development has been made final and now you start 
writing code for your project. Let’s assume you would work on back-end, two colleagues would work on UI, and last one would work on interconnecting back-end 
and front-end. A naive approach would be that you guys would agree before that whole code would be maintained on your laptop. Thus development is centralized 
to your laptop. After sometime into development, you would observe that maintaining the work-flow becomes tedious. Suppose, the UI guys want to test some
functionality or develop some new feature, they would need access to your laptop, even though they developed on their own computers. 
Similarly the interconnecting of UI and back-end would also require you laptop’s access. Now consider you’re out on a vacation or other stuff, the whole development 
process comes to a halt as your laptop is unavailable. Also, if some new functionality is added or existing functionality is modified it needs to be shared with 
others on development team. Some kind of system is required that makes development easier. The answer is Version Control System. Instead of your laptop, agree on 
centralizing your code on VCS platforms like Git, Subversion, DCVS, Mercurial, etc. VCS treats each file/change as a revision and coordinates work on those change 
among multiple people providing information like who edited or created it, when, what changes were made, etc. It also provides the ability to revert a file/change 
to a previous revision for allowing editors to track each other's edits, correct mistakes, and defend against vandalism and spamming. VCS can be distributed or 
centralized, but distributed has more advantages.Thus development doesn’t depend on a single entity as VCS tends to be distributed. Each entity is treated with 
equal importance as others.


Version control: It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

GitHub= Git + Hub

What is Git?

Git is an Open Source DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM. 

It is mainly used for source code management in software development. 
It is a Command Line Interface(CLI) tool and can be mastered easily
